DRAFT! DRAFT!

## Homework

Each weekly Homework assignment is its own PDF.  See the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf) for due dates.

You will upload each Homework assignment as a single PDF using Gradescope at the [Canvas page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7017).  See [this Tech Help page](https://bueler.github.io/calc2/techHelp.html), part of my Calculus II website, for scanning/uploading advice.

The problems from the textbook will be graded for completion because solutions are already available online ([Resources](resources.html)).  The roman numeral problems will be graded for correctness.
