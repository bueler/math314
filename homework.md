## Homework

Each weekly Homework assignment is either listed below or it has its own PDF which is linked below.  Each assignment is due on 11:59pm on the date listed; see the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf) for all due dates.

You will upload each Homework assignment as a single PDF using Gradescope at the [Canvas page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7017).  See [this Tech Help page](https://bueler.github.io/calc2/techHelp.html), part of my Calculus II website, for scanning/uploading advice.

The problems from the textbook will be graded for completion because solutions are already available online; see the [Resources](resources.html) page for links.  The "P" problems will be graded for correctness.

The list below will grow as the semester goes on.
