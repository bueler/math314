## Homework

Each weekly Homework assignment has its own PDF (link below).  Homework is due on 11:59pm on the date listed.  See the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf) for due dates.

Please upload each assignment as a single PDF using Gradescope at the [Canvas page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7017).  See [this Calculus II Tech Help page](https://bueler.github.io/calc2/techHelp.html) for scanning/uploading advice.

The problems from the textbook will be graded for completion.  (Solutions are already available online; see the [Resources](resources.html) page for links.)  The "P" problems will be graded for correctness.
