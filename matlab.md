## Matlab and Octave

Either Matlab or Octave will work just fine for the computer calculations in this course.  Here is a guide to getting started.

### Getting a copy

#### Matlab online is free to UAF students (I think)

This is available by using your `@alaska.edu` address.  Go to [www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html) and check for campus-wide access.  You should get an email saying you can sign up for a Mathworks account.  Once you are signed in, namely at [matlab.mathworks.com](https://matlab.mathworks.com/), you can click on the *Open MATLAB Online* button.  Because you use this through a browser, it may sometimes be slow because of internet issues.

#### Download the student version of Matlab

See [www.mathworks.com/store/link/products/student/SV](https://www.mathworks.com/store/link/products/student/SV).  I think this is free too, because of your `@alaska.edu` email.

#### Octave online is free

Go to [octave-online.net](https://octave-online.net/) and get started.  Because you use this through a browser, it may sometimes be slow because of internet issues.

#### Download Octave ... also free

I use an Octave executable on my Linux machines.  There are executables for Windows and macOS; see the Download tab at [www.gnu.org/software/octave/index](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index).

### Learning Matlab/Octave

My basic advice is to just start trying to use it as a calculator, and as a function plotter and such.  Within a few days you'll be used to the basic language.

Matlab/Octave are so natural for linear algebra that not much explanation is needed, but ask questions in class!  Yes, I'm happy to answer "dumb syntax" questions.  I have such questions all the time about new computer stuff!  For new languages, everyone gets hung-up at some point on which symbols to type next.

However, if you want tutorials and videos, the Mathworks official material is great: [www.mathworks.com/support/learn-with-matlab-tutorials.html](https://www.mathworks.com/support/learn-with-matlab-tutorials.html).
