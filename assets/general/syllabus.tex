\heading{Description, Course Goals \& Student Learning Outcomes}
Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics which covers vectors, matrices, and linear equations.  It is central to all areas of applied and pure mathematics because vectors are the precise way to describe complicated things by using many numbers.  Linear algebra is used in all sciences, and fields of engineering, when modeling natural phenomena and computing efficiently using models.  Even nonlinear systems are approximated at first-order, using derivatives, by linear algebra objects.

All real-world linear algebra problems are solved using computers.  In this course will use, and introduce, Matlab for this purpose.  Matlab was designed for teaching linear algebra, but it is now a standard tool for engineering and science, and you may be expected to use it in your other courses.  On the other hand, understanding linear algebra will require doing by-hand calculations with simple numbers and in low dimensions.

By the end of the course you will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts and algorithms of linear algebra, including well-known theorems and matrix factorizations.  You will have seen significant applications in diverse fields.v You will be well-equipped to use linear algebra in more-advanced mathematics, and to use vectors and matrices in science and/or engineering.


\heading{Schedule and Online Materials}
The \href{https://bueler.github.io/math314/}{course website} contains a \href{https://bueler.github.io/math314/assets/general/schedule.pdf}{Schedule} listing the textbook sections to be covered each class, the dates each Homework is due, plus the dates for the Midterm Exams and the Final Exam.  You should consult this schedule frequently.  I will announce any Schedule adjustments in class.

Most course materials (Syllabus, Homework assignments, etc.) will be posted on the \href{https://bueler.github.io/math314/}{course webpage}.  Some course materials (grades, announcements, etc.) will be available on the \href{https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/7017}{Canvas site}.  Each website links to the other.


\heading{Class Time}
There are three hours of class meetings with your instructor every week: MWF 9:15 am -- 10:15 pm  Gruening 413.  You are expected to attend class and to participate.  Exams (below) and worksheets, including group activities, will occur in-class.

\heading{Office Hours and Communication}
My Office Hours are online at \href{http://bueler.github.io/OffHrs.htm}{\texttt{bueler.github.io/OffHrs.htm}}.  Students can also schedule meetings with me outside of regular office hours.  I will use Canvas to send announcements.  If I need to contact you outside of class times, I'll try to email via Canvas.  Please set the email address in Canvas to one that you check regularly!


\heading{Evaluation and Grades}
Grades are determined as follows.  (Each component of the grade is discussed below.)

\noindent \emph{CORRECTED FINAL DATE!!}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Homework & 30\% \\
\hline
Midterm Exam 1: Mon 2/14, in-class & 20\% \\
\hline
Midterm Exam 2: Mon 3/28, in-class & 20\%  \\
\hline
Final Exam: \emph{Friday 4/29} 8--10am & 30\% \\
\hline
total & 100\% \, \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{llll}
A  & 93--100\%& C  & 68--75\%  \\
A- & 90--92\% & C- & not given \\
B+ & 87--89\% & D+ & 65--67\%  \\
B  & 82--86\% & D  & 60--65\%  \\
B- & 79--81\% & D- & 57--59\%  \\
C+ & 76--78\% & F  & $\le$ 56\%
\end{tabular}
\end{multicols}

\vspace{-3mm}
These ranges are a guarantee and a lower bound. I reserve the right to increase your grade above these ranges based on the actual difficulty of the work and/or on average class performance. Any such increases will preserve grade ordering by weighted total score. 


\heading{Homework}
The weekly Homework assignments will include a selection of problems from the textbook, plus problems I have written (the ``\textbf{P}'' problems).  Each Homework assignment should be turned in as a PDF via Gradescope, accessed via Canvas.  (Help with scanning homework can be found on the \href{https://uaf-math251.github.io/techHelp.html}{Calculus II Tech Help page}.)  Assignments are due by 11:59pm on the dates stated on the \href{https://bueler.github.io/math314/assets/general/schedule.pdf}{Schedule}.  The list of Homework problems is at the \href{https://bueler.github.io/math314/homework.html}{Homework} webpage.

Complete worked solutions to all textbook Homework problems are already available online at the author's website.  (See the \href{https://bueler.github.io/math314/resources.html}{Resources} page.)  Thus this part of the Homework will be graded for \emph{completion}.  The ``\textbf{P}'' problems will be graded for \emph{correctness}.

Problems very similar to the Homework problems will appear on the in-class Exams.


\heading{Exams}
There are two Midterm Exams this semester, to be held on the dates shown in the schedule.  Midterms are given during the class time.  Make-up Midterms will be given only for documented extenuating circumstances, at my discretion.

The cumulative Final Exam will be held at the day/time listed in the online schedule: \textbf{8:00am--10:00am Wednesday April 27}.


\heading{Tutoring and Resources}
The Math and Stat Lab, Chapman Building Room 305, offers tutors.  For schedules and availability see \href{http://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}{\texttt{www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}}.

Free one-on-one (or small group) tutoring is available in Chapman Room 201. You must schedule an appointment; see \href{http://www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}{\texttt{www.uaf.edu/dms/mathlab/}}.

\heading{Rules and Policies}
\vskip -20pt

\subheading{Incomplete Grade} 
Incomplete (I) will only be given in
  DMS courses in cases where
  the student has completed the majority (normally all but the last
  three weeks) of a course with a grade of C or better, but for
  personal reasons beyond his/her control has been unable to complete
  the course during the regular term. Negligence or indifference are
  not acceptable reasons for granting an incomplete grade.

\subheading{Late Withdrawals} 
A withdrawal after the deadline from a DMS course will
  normally be granted only in cases where the student is performing
  satisfactorily (i.e., C or better) in a course, but has exceptional
  reasons, beyond his/her control, for being unable to complete the
  course.  These exceptional reasons should be detailed in writing to
  the instructor, Department Chair and the Dean.

\subheading{No Early Final Examinations}
Final examinations for DMS
  courses shall not be held earlier than the date and time published
  in the official term schedule. Normally, a student will not be
  allowed to take a final exam early. Exceptions can be made by
  individual instructors, but should only be allowed in exceptional
  circumstances and in a manner which doesn't endanger the security of
  the exam.

\subheading{Academic Dishonesty}
Academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, will not
be tolerated.  It is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct
and will be punished according to UAF procedures.
 
\subheading{COVID-19 statement}
Students should keep up-to-date on the university's policies, practices, and mandates related to COVID-19 by regularly checking this website:

\href{https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/coronavirus/uaf?authuser=0}{\texttt{sites.google.com/alaska.edu/coronavirus/uaf}}

Students are expected to adhere to the university's policies, practices, and mandates and are subject to disciplinary actions if they do not comply.

\subheading{Student protections statement}
UAF embraces and grows a culture of respect, diversity, inclusion, and caring. Students at this university are protected against sexual harassment and discrimination (Title IX). Faculty members are designated as responsible employees which means they are required to report sexual misconduct. For more information on your rights as a student and the resources available to you to resolve problems, please go to the following site:

\href{https://catalog.uaf.edu/academics-regulations/students-rights-responsibilities/}{\texttt{catalog.uaf.edu/academics-regulations/students-rights-responsibilities/}}

\subheading{Disability services statement}
I will work with the Office of Disability Services (\href{https://www.uaf.edu/disabilityservices/}{\texttt{www.uaf.edu/disabilityservices/}}) to provide reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities.
